# YouTube Streamer Recommendation System

## Overview:
This project revolves around analyzing a dataset comprising details of the top 1000 YouTube streamers. Key variables considered include the number of likes, comments, country of origin, and content category. The primary objective is to build a recommendation system to provide personalized content suggestions to users based on their preferences and viewing history.

## Dataset:
The dataset contains information about the top 1000 YouTube streamers and includes the following columns:
- Number of likes
- Number of comments
- Country of origin
- Content category

## Approach:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and data imbalances.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.
   - Visualized the distribution of variables and relationships between features.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Developed a recommendation system using machine learning techniques.
   - Considered collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods.
   - Evaluated model performance and fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal results.

## Results:
The project resulted in a recommendation system capable of suggesting relevant content to users based on their preferences and viewing habits. The system leverages insights from the dataset to deliver personalized recommendations, enhancing the user experience on the YouTube platform.

## Conclusion:
Through this project, valuable insights were gained into the preferences and behaviors of top YouTube streamers. The developed recommendation system can potentially improve user engagement and satisfaction by delivering tailored content suggestions. Future enhancements could involve incorporating additional features and refining the recommendation algorithms for enhanced accuracy and effectiveness.

## Future Work:
- Explore incorporating additional features such as video duration, and upload frequency.
- Investigate advanced recommendation algorithms and techniques for further enhancing model performance.
- Conduct user testing and feedback analysis to iteratively improve the recommendation system based on user preferences and satisfaction.
